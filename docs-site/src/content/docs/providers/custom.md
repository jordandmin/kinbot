title: Adding Custom Providers
description: Extend KinBot with custom AI providers via plugins.

Beyond the 23 built-in providers, you can add custom providers through the **plugin system**.

## Plugin Providers

Plugins can register new AI providers that appear alongside built-in ones in the Settings UI. This is useful for:

- Proprietary or internal LLM endpoints
- Custom model hosting (e.g., vLLM, TGI)
- Specialized embedding or image generation services
- Proxy services with custom authentication

## Implementation

A plugin exposes providers through its `providers` export. Each provider entry declares a `definition` (the implementation), display metadata, and its capabilities so KinBot knows where to use it.

```typescript
// In your plugin's main file
export const providers = {
  'my-llm': {
    definition: myProviderImplementation,
    displayName: 'My Custom LLM',
    capabilities: ['llm', 'embedding'],
    noApiKey: false,
    apiKeyUrl: 'https://my-service.com/keys',
  },
}
```

KinBot automatically registers plugin providers with a `plugin_<name>_` prefix (e.g., `plugin_my-plugin_my-llm`). Once registered, the provider appears in **Settings > Providers** alongside built-in ones and can be configured with an API key and base URL.

## OpenAI-Compatible Endpoints

Many self-hosted solutions expose an OpenAI-compatible API. For these, you can often use the built-in **OpenAI** or **OpenRouter** provider with a custom base URL, without needing a plugin:

1. Go to **Settings > Providers > OpenAI**
2. Set the **Base URL** to your endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/v1`)
3. Set the API key if required

This works with vLLM, llama.cpp server, LocalAI, and other OpenAI-compatible services.

## Ollama

For local models, [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) is the recommended approach. It's a built-in provider that requires no API key:

1. Install and run Ollama on your machine
2. Pull models: `ollama pull llama3` or `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`
3. In KinBot, configure the Ollama provider with the base URL (default: `http://localhost:11434`)

From Docker, use `http://host.docker.internal:11434` instead of `localhost`.
