# Contributing to KinBot

Thanks for considering contributing to KinBot! Whether it's a bug fix, new provider, feature, or docs improvement, every contribution helps.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) ≥ 1.0
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- At least one AI provider API key (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, etc.)

### Local Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarlBurroW/kinbot.git
cd kinbot
bun install
bun run db:migrate
bun run dev
```

This starts both the Vite dev server (frontend) and the Bun server (backend) with hot reload. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

### Project Structure

### Useful Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `bun run dev` | Start dev server (client + server) |
| `bun run build` | Production build |
| `bun run db:generate` | Generate DB migrations (Drizzle) |
| `bun run db:migrate` | Run pending migrations |
| `bun test` | Run tests |

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Use the [bug report template](https://github.com/MarlBurroW/kinbot/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml). Include:
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Browser, OS, and KinBot version

### Requesting Features

Use the [feature request template](https://github.com/MarlBurroW/kinbot/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml). Describe the problem you're solving, not just the solution you want.

### Submitting Code

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch** from `main`: `git checkout -b feat/my-feature`
3. **Make your changes** with clear, focused commits
4. **Test** your changes: `bun test` and manual testing
5. **Push** and open a Pull Request

### Adding a Provider

Providers are self-contained adapters in `src/server/providers/`. To add one:

1. Create `src/server/providers/<name>.ts` (use an existing one as template)
2. Implement the `ProviderDefinition` interface: `testConnection()` + `listModels()`
3. Register it in `src/server/providers/index.ts`
4. Add the type to the `ProviderType` union in `src/shared/types.ts`
5. Commit: `feat: add <name> provider`

For OpenAI-compatible providers, reuse the pattern from `openai.ts` with a custom `baseUrl`.

### Adding a Channel

Channel adapters live in `src/server/channels/` and implement the `ChannelAdapter` interface:

1. Create the adapter file in `src/server/channels/`
2. Implement: `start()`, `stop()`, `sendMessage()`, `validateConfig()`, `getBotInfo()`
3. Register it in `src/server/channels/index.ts`
4. Add the platform to `ChannelPlatform` in `src/shared/types.ts`
5. Commit: `feat: add <platform> channel`

## Code Style

- **TypeScript** strict mode
- **Imports** use the `@/` alias (configured in tsconfig)
- **Logging** via `createLogger('scope:name')`
- Prefer `fetch` over heavy SDK dependencies
- Keep files focused: one provider/channel per file

## Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits:

- `feat: add <thing>` for new features
- `fix: resolve <issue>` for bug fixes
- `docs: update <what>` for documentation
- `site: <description>` for landing page changes
- `refactor:`, `test:`, `ci:`, `chore:` as needed

## Landing Page

The landing page lives in `site/` and deploys automatically to GitHub Pages on push to `main`.

```bash
cd site
bun install
bun run dev      # Local dev server
bun run build    # Test production build
```
