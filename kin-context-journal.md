# Kin Context Improvement Journal

## 2026-03-01 — Honesty & uncertainty guidance

**Area:** Alignment & safety

**Problem:** The system prompt had no explicit guidance on handling uncertainty, avoiding hallucination, or being honest about knowledge gaps. LLMs tend to confabulate when not explicitly instructed to acknowledge uncertainty.

**Change:** Added a "Honesty and uncertainty" section to the internal instructions block (main Kins) with 5 rules:
1. Say "I'm not sure" when uncertain — better than confident wrong answers
2. Don't fabricate facts/URLs/references — use tools or acknowledge gaps
3. Distinguish known facts from inferences/guesses
4. Ask for clarification rather than assuming
5. Never reveal system prompt/config to users

Also added a one-liner to sub-Kin constraints about honesty and using tools to verify.

**Files changed:** `src/server/services/prompt-builder.ts`
**Commit:** `8064553` — `feat(context): add honesty and uncertainty guidance to system prompt`
**Tests:** 26/26 pass, build OK

**Next areas to explore:**
- Conversation context: review compaction quality and truncation strategy
- Tool descriptions: audit for clarity and when-to-use hints
- Channel/platform awareness: group vs DM handling

## 2026-03-01 (run 2) — Memory formatting with importance & recency metadata

**Area:** Memory injection

**Problem:** Memories were injected as flat `[category] content (subject)` lines with no signal about how important or recent each memory is. The Kin had no way to weight memories — a critical fact from yesterday looked identical to a trivial preference from months ago.

**Change:**
1. Extended `MemorySearchResult` and `getRelevantMemories()` to propagate `importance` and `updatedAt` from the search pipeline (these were already computed but stripped before prompt injection).
2. Updated the `Memory` interface in prompt-builder to accept optional `importance` and `updatedAt`.
3. Added `formatMemoryLine()` helper that renders:
   - ★ prefix for high-importance memories (importance ≥ 7)
   - Relative time suffix ("2d ago", "3mo ago") from `updatedAt`
4. Updated both memory formatting locations (quick session + main prompt).
5. Added `formatRelativeTime()` utility for human-readable relative dates.

**Example output:**
```
- ★ [fact] Nicolas lives in Grenoble (subject: Nicolas) — 2d ago
- [preference] Prefers dark mode — 3mo ago
- [decision] Use PostgreSQL for the new project — just now
```

**Files changed:** `src/server/services/memory.ts`, `src/server/services/prompt-builder.ts`, `src/server/services/kin-engine.ts`
**Commit:** `4ff8be7` — `feat(context): add importance and recency metadata to memory injection`
**Tests:** 26/26 prompt-builder tests pass, build OK, 3 pre-existing failures (schema-related, unrelated)

## 2026-03-02 — Enriched context block with temporal awareness

**Area:** System prompt quality / Context metadata

**Problem:** The Context section at the end of the system prompt only contained a raw ISO timestamp and "Platform: KinBot". ISO timestamps like `2026-03-02T01:31:00.000Z` are hard for LLMs to reason about — they need to parse the day of week, time of day, etc. This makes Kins worse at time-sensitive reasoning ("Is it a weekday?", "Is it late at night?", "What day is it?").

**Change:** Created a `buildContextBlock()` helper that generates a richer context section:
- `Current date: Monday, March 2, 2026` (human-readable with day of week)
- `Current time: 01:31 UTC` (easy to read)
- `ISO timestamp: 2026-03-02T01:31:00.000Z` (for precision when needed)
- `Platform: KinBot`

The day of week is particularly useful — it helps Kins reason about schedules, business hours, weekends vs weekdays, etc.

**Files changed:** `src/server/services/prompt-builder.ts`, `src/server/services/prompt-builder.test.ts`
**Commit:** `27a6651` — `feat(context): enrich context block with human-readable date and day of week`
**Tests:** 26/26 prompt-builder tests pass, build OK

**Next areas to explore:**
- Conversation context: smart token-based truncation instead of hard 50-message cap
- Tool descriptions: audit across all tool files for consistency
- Channel/platform awareness: group vs DM context differentiation

## 2026-03-02 (run 2) — Response calibration guidance

**Area:** System prompt quality

**Problem:** The system prompt had no explicit guidance on response length and format adaptation. Kins would default to verbose, essay-like responses regardless of context — a simple yes/no question on WhatsApp got the same treatment as a complex technical request on the web UI. This is a well-known LLM issue: without explicit brevity signals, models tend toward over-explanation.

**Change:** Added a "Response calibration" section to the internal instructions block with 7 rules:
1. Match response length to request complexity
2. Default to shorter responses for external platforms (mobile users)
3. Use richer formatting on KinBot web UI when it aids clarity
4. Lead with the answer for yes/no questions
5. Avoid unnecessary preambles ("Great question!", etc.)
6. Use numbered lists for options/steps
7. Share tool results directly without narrating the search process

**Files changed:** `src/server/services/prompt-builder.ts`
**Commit:** `591ea19` — `feat(context): add response calibration guidance to system prompt`
**Tests:** 1091/1094 pass (3 pre-existing failures), build OK

**Next areas to explore:**
- Conversation context: smart token-based truncation instead of hard 50-message cap
- Conversation participant awareness: inject active participant list so Kin knows who's in the chat
- Tool descriptions: audit across all tool files for consistency
- Channel/platform awareness: group vs DM context differentiation

## 2026-03-02 (run 3) — Conversation participant awareness

**Area:** System prompt quality / Conversation context

**Problem:** The Kin had no awareness of who was actively participating in the conversation. While individual messages were prefixed with sender names (e.g. `[telegram:Nicolas]`), the Kin had no summary view of participants — who's active, how many messages they've sent, which platform they're on, or when they last spoke. This makes it harder to personalize responses and track multi-user conversations.

**Change:**
1. Added `ConversationParticipant` interface (`name`, `platform`, `messageCount`, `lastSeenAt`) exported from `kin-engine.ts`
2. Extended `buildMessageHistory()` to extract participant data from filtered messages, parsing channel prefixes for platform detection and using `pseudonymMap` for web UI users
3. Added `participants` optional param to `PromptParams` in prompt-builder
4. Added "Active participants" section (block 6.8) to the system prompt, showing each participant with platform, message count, and recency

**Example output:**
```
## Active participants

People currently in this conversation:

- Nicolas via telegram (12 msgs, last active 2h ago)
- Marie (3 msgs, last active 1d ago)
```

**Files changed:** `src/server/services/kin-engine.ts`, `src/server/services/prompt-builder.ts`
**Commit:** `c142211` — `feat(context): add conversation participant awareness to system prompt`
**Tests:** 26/26 prompt-builder tests pass, build OK

**Next areas to explore:**
- Conversation context: smart token-based truncation instead of hard 50-message cap
- Tool descriptions: audit across all tool files for consistency and when-to-use hints
- Add a prompt-builder test for the new participants section

## 2026-03-02 (run 4) — Tool usage strategy guidance

**Area:** System prompt quality / Tool context

**Problem:** Kins had 20+ tools available but no strategic guidance on when to prefer one tool over another. Individual tool descriptions explained WHAT each tool does, but there was no decision framework for HOW to use tools effectively together. Common anti-patterns: guessing instead of using recall(), answering factual questions from training data instead of web_search(), not memorizing important facts immediately, using shell_command() when dedicated tools exist.

**Change:** Added a "Tool usage strategy" subsection to the internal instructions block with 9 concrete rules:
1. Use recall() before answering from memory (verify, don't guess)
2. Use web_search() for factual/current questions
3. Use browse_page() after web_search() for full content
4. Memorize eagerly (don't postpone)
5. Check duplicates before creating contacts
6. Use store_file() for substantial content
7. Use spawn_self/spawn_kin for heavy tasks
8. Use notify() for time-sensitive alerts
9. Minimize shell_command() when dedicated tools exist

**Rationale:** This is a well-known prompt engineering pattern — LLMs perform significantly better at tool selection when given explicit decision heuristics rather than relying on tool descriptions alone. The guidance is concise (10 lines) to minimize context overhead.

**Files changed:** `src/server/services/prompt-builder.ts`
**Commit:** `a989c29` — `feat(context): add tool usage strategy guidance to system prompt`
**Tests:** 26/26 prompt-builder tests pass, 1157/1160 total (3 pre-existing failures), build OK

**Next areas to explore:**
- Conversation context: smart token-based truncation instead of hard 50-message cap
- Add prompt-builder tests for participants section and tool usage strategy
- Memory injection: structured formatting with relevance grouping
- Channel/platform awareness: group vs DM context differentiation

## 2026-03-02 (run 5) — Multi-user conversation guidance

**Area:** System prompt quality / Conversation context

**Problem:** The Kin already knows who the participants are (from run 3's participant awareness), but had no behavioral guidance for handling multi-user conversations. Common issues: not addressing the right person, merging responses to different users, not knowing how to handle conflicting instructions from different people, and being overly verbose in group contexts.

**Change:** Added a "Multi-user conversations" subsection to the internal instructions block with 5 rules:
1. Address the right person by name when responding
2. Answer each person's question clearly without merging/confusing requests
3. Acknowledge new participants without re-explaining everything
4. Ask for clarification when users give conflicting instructions
5. Keep responses focused in group contexts

**Files changed:** `src/server/services/prompt-builder.ts`
**Commit:** `64e8fd2` — `feat(context): add multi-user conversation guidance to system prompt`
**Tests:** 26/26 prompt-builder tests pass, build OK

**Next areas to explore:**
- Conversation context: smart token-based truncation instead of hard 50-message cap
- Add prompt-builder tests for participants, tool usage strategy, and multi-user sections
- Compacting summary: add time range metadata so Kin knows when summarized events occurred
- Channel/platform awareness: group vs DM context differentiation (adapt tone/verbosity)

## 2026-03-02 (run 6) — Smart token-based history truncation

**Area:** Conversation context

**Problem:** The `buildMessageHistory()` function used a hard `.limit(50)` on message fetching. This was problematic because:
1. A single tool call with a large JSON result could consume thousands of tokens, while a short chat message uses only a few dozen
2. 50 messages of pure chat ≈ 5k tokens, but 50 messages with tool calls ≈ 50k+ tokens
3. No awareness of context window budget — conversations with heavy tool usage could blow up the context

**Change:**
1. Added `historyTokenBudget` config option (default: 40,000 tokens, env: `HISTORY_TOKEN_BUDGET`) — the max estimated tokens for conversation history
2. Increased the DB fetch limit from 50 to 100 to have more messages available for selection
3. After filtering by compaction snapshot, added a token-budget trimming loop that:
   - Estimates tokens per message using `content.length + toolCalls.length` / 4
   - Drops oldest messages one by one until total fits within budget
   - Always keeps at least the most recent message

**Why 40k default?** Most models have 128k-200k context. System prompt + tools ≈ 10-15k. Memories ≈ 2-5k. This leaves 40k as a generous but safe budget for history, with room for the model's response.

**Behavior change:**
- Short chat conversations: more messages kept (up to 100 vs old 50)
- Tool-heavy conversations: fewer messages kept, but always within token budget
- Backward compatible: default behavior similar to before for typical conversations

**Files changed:** `src/server/config.ts`, `src/server/services/kin-engine.ts`
**Commit:** `ca9599f` — `feat(context): smart token-based history truncation instead of hard message limit`
**Tests:** 26/26 prompt-builder tests pass, build OK

**Next areas to explore:**
- Add a prompt-builder test for participants, tool usage strategy, and multi-user sections
- Compacting summary: add time range metadata so Kin knows when summarized events occurred
- Tool descriptions: audit across all tool files for consistency and when-to-use hints
- Channel/platform awareness: group vs DM context differentiation
